     * Count the number of occurrences of the dependent event that would roll up to the given occurrence of this event.
     * It is assumed that the two events have like recurrences (e.g both meet on Tuesdays) but may differ in
     * the number of periods skipped. It is also assumed that the dependent schedule starts on startingOccurrence
     * of this event.
     *
     * <p> See {@liink FeeInstallment#createMergedFeeInstallments()} in which this method is used to determine how
     * many fee installments roll up to meeting or loan installments.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, if this event's schedule is every Tuesday but the dependent schedule is every other Tuesday,
     * and the dependent schedule starts on this event's third occurrence:
     *
     *<pre>
     * ---------------------------------------------

     *|returns     | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |  0 |
     * ---------------------------------------------
     *</pre>
     *
     *<p>A more complex example: This event is scheduled for every third week and the dependent event is scheduled
     *for every other week. Assume the dependent schedule starts with this event's 5th occurrence (table has
     *one column for each week)
     *
     *<pre>
     * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * | this occurrences        |  5 |    |    |  6 |    |    |  7 |    |    |  8 |    |    |  9 |
     * | dependent occurrences.  |  X |    |  X |    |  X |    |  X |    |  X |    |    |  X |    |
     * | returns                 |  1 |    |    |  1 |    |    |  2 |    |    |  1 |    |    |  2 |
     * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *</pre>
     *

     *for every second week:

     *
     * @param dependentEvent the ScheduledEvent whose dates roll up to dates of this event
     * @param occurrence the index of the date of this event that dependent events roll up to
     * @param startingOccurrence the dependent event's occurrences start with this occurrence of this event
     * @return the number of installments of the dependent event falling between the given installment of this event
     *  and the previous installment, not including the previous but including the given installment.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if occurrence or startingOccurrence is not positive
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the two events' recurrences do not match

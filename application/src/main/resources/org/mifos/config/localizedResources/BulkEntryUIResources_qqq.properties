bulkEntry.totalGroupCenter=%s is replaced with "Group"\n\nThe reason the string "Group" is not part of the message is because it is a customizable label in the Mifos application. To be correct, %s is replaced either with "Group" or a synonym of Group if the label has been customized.\n\n(documentation copied from [[Thread:Support/About Mifos:Cse-bulkEntry.totalGroupCenter/nl/reply|this thread]])
